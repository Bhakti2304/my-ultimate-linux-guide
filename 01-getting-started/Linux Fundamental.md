# Fundamental and history of Linux

What is Operating System?
- It is a software program that knows how to use Hardware and performs process management, memory management, device management, network management. 
- Application talks to OS, which allocates CPU, Memory,and required Hardware resources according to the Program.
- This is how the program interacts with OS, and OS interacts with the Hardware System.
- For the User, the OS provides CLI or GUI to do interaction between USer and Hardware System.
- So, thorugh OS Application and User can interact with Hardware System. It is the Heart of the Computer.
- Popular OS are Linux, Windows, Mac OS.


History:
- In 1960s, first invented Unix. Before Unix it is difficult for App developers to interact with Hardware. Unix solves this problem and became Popular.
- In 1970s Minix was invented. It is partially open source.
- In 1980s Microsoft released Windows. It enriched GUI without using commands, unlike Unix and Minix. 
- In 1990s, a person called Linus worked on Linux Kernel and became popular. It is open source, super secure, and backed by developers.

# Core components of a Linux Machine

The main component of a Linux Machine is the Linux Kernel.

- The interaction of Harware such as Process management, memory management, device management, network management, everything handles through Kernel.
- On top of Linux Kernel, there are System Libraries(OpenSSL, libc, glibc etc), System Utilities( ls, grep, systmectl etc) and On top of that there is CLI or GUI. In case of Linux, there are CLI such as Bash, Zsh, Fish etc.

# Linux Distributions

Ubuntu, Redhat, Debian, Alpine, Fedora use the OpenSource Linux and add some features or commands or package managers(it helps you to deploy/install dependencies like Python, it helps you to upgrade/ maintain/ delete version of of package like Python or Java) to make their own OS and distribute them as new products.

- Therefore, if you have shell script running on the Ubuntu also have Redhat, due to having same underlying libraries, packages.
- Ubuntu is the most Popular distribution among others.
